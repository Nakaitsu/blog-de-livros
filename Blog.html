    </figure>

    <p>"St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves" by Karen Russell, a Pulitzer Prize in Fiction finalist for her
      novel Swamplandia!, is more or less a <strong>classic of short-form fantasy</strong> by now: The story follows a pack of
      children, born to werewolf parents (their condition skips a generation), who are forced to attend a "civilizing"
      finishing school. But of course, making wolf girls into productive members of society won't be as easy as all
      that. This is just one of the major quirky stories you can find in Russell's collection of the same name — and
      if you haven't got quite enough after reading through those, you can also pick up her new story collection
      Orange World.</p>

    <h3 id="link2">"The City Born Great" - by <em>N.K. Jemisin</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 22/12/2020</h>

    </figure>

    <p>N.K. Jemisin creates strange and beautiful cities in her fantasy novels, like The Broken Earth Trilogy and The
      Inheritance Trilogy. But in "The City Born Great," she re-creates a city you may have heard of before: New York.
      In this inventive tale, New York has grown old enough that it is time for it to be "born," but only if one
      reluctant midwife can keep its ancient enemies at bay.</p>

    <h3 id="link3">"The Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains" - by <em>Neil Gaiman</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 22/12/2020</p>

      <figcaption>The Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>You can hardly talk about fantasy short stories without talking about American Gods author Neil Gaiman. The
      story "The Truth is a Cave in the Black Mountains" is classic Gaiman from start to finish: It's a <strong>dark journey</strong>
      to find a terrible truth, with plenty of magic and ancient myth along the way. If you want more Neil Gaiman
      after reading through this short tale, try his novels, or one of the many film and TV adaptations of his work,
      including <strong>Stardust</strong>, <strong>Coraline</strong>, <strong>American Gods, and Good Omens</strong>.</p>

    <h3 id="link4">"As Good As New" - by <em>Charlie Jane Anders</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 22/12/2020</p>

      <img

        alt="As Good As New">
      <figcaption>As Good As New</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>The <em>"three wishes"</em> is a trope as old as fantasy itself — you know the one. Someone is granted three wishes, and
      they inevitably choose unwisely, and everything goes to hell. In "As Good as New", Charlie Jane Anders — <strong>author
      of All the Birds in the Sky and The City in the Middle of the Night</strong> — puts a new spin on the whole
      genie-in-the-bottle thing with this wholly original story, set after the end of the world. When you're the last
      human on earth, after all, you have to be careful with what you wish for.</p>

    <h3 id="link5">"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" - by <em>Ursula Le Guin</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 22/12/2020</p>

      <img
        src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/5/8/814ef5c7-63c5-444b-9c74-32ba0b159651-the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas-1.jpg?w=632&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"
        alt="The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas">
      <figcaption>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" exists somewhere between <strong>fantasy</strong> and <strong>speculative fiction</strong>. Without spoiling
      too much, it's a <strong>lovely</strong>, <strong>horrifying story</strong> that builds a utopian city of dreams and then asks us to consider the
      hidden costs of a "perfect" world. Who suffers so that others can live out their fantasies? It's classic Ursula
      K. Le Guin, and after reading it, you'll definitely want to check out some of her novels, including her iconic
      work The Left Hand of Darkness.</p>

  <div class="book">
    <h3 id="link6">"One True Love" - by <em>Malinda Lo</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 22/12/2020</p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/5/8/6e7b9da0-12f4-4189-a52e-a2346a3e2c91-lightspeed_93_february_2018-683x1024.jpg?w=632&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"
        alt="One True Love">
      <figcaption>One True Love</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Princes and princesses and true love are all staples of the high fantasy genre. In "One True Love," <strong>a little
      princess is born in the midst of tragedy</strong>. Even worse, a prophecy at her birth foretells that if she ever finds
      her elusive "one true love," it shall be the downfall of the king. And if you've ever read a princess story
      before, you already know that prophecies are not so easily prevented. <strong>Malinda Lo, the author of Ash</strong>, is known
      for her retellings that challenge the status quo, and if that sounds like something up your alley, you'll be
      hooked on this story and her novels.</p>

  <div class="book">
    <h3 id="link7">"The Snow Train" - by <em>Ken Liu</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 22/12/2020</p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/5/8/7057893a-a1e1-453e-bcfc-5b73d5689455-lightspeed-april-18.jpg?w=632&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"
        alt="The Snow Train">
      <figcaption>The Snow Train</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>"The Snow Train" is a <strong>departure from kings and princesses in far away realms</strong>. And by that I mean, it's set in
      Boston. A story about snow and magical transit systems (and a little bit about the American Dream), The Snow
      Train takes one young boy from his foster home to a very surreal train ride. It'll put you in a very particular
      mood — one that you won't be able to break free from for quite a while.</p>

    <h3 id="link8">"Ogres of East Africa" - by <em>Sofia Samatar</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 20/12/2020</p>

      <img

        alt="Ogres of East Africa">
      <figcaption>Ogres of East Africa</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>If you like <strong>ogres</strong>, <strong>inventive storytelling formats</strong>, or <strong>the brilliant mind of Sofia Samatar</strong>, then you're going to
      want to drop everything and read "Ogres of East Africa." It's a story told through an ogre cataloger's notes,
      and it's sheer creative genius. As the author learns more about the lives of ogres, we gradually learn about his
      own life, too.</p>

    <h3 id="link9">"The Smallest Dragonboy" - by <em>Anne McCaffrey</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 20/12/2020</p>

      <img

        alt="The Smallest Dragonboy">
      <figcaption>The Smallest Dragonboy</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>If you don't automatically want to read a story entitled "The Smallest Dragonboy," then I just don't know what
      to tell you. Anne McCaffrey is the undisputed queen of kid-and-dragon fiction (sorry, George R.R. Martin), and
      this is a delightful short installment of her <strong>fantasy/sci-fi</strong> series set on the dragon-filled planet of Pern. And
      if you simply need more Anna McCaffrey after reading it, some other famous fantasy authors have recommendations
      for you.</p>

    <h3 id="link10">"Seasons of Glass and Iron" - by <em>Amal El-Mohtar</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 20/12/2020</p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/5/8/7162ba7e-9d5d-4290-9b6c-3d571bcca6ba-uncanny-issue13coverv2_large.jpg?w=632&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"
        alt="Seasons of Glass and Iron">
      <figcaption>Seasons of Glass and Iron</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Some of the best fantasy takes <strong>old fairy tales</strong> and gives them a <strong>fresh twist</strong>. "Seasons of Glass and Iron" is
      exactly that: Tabitha and Amira are both trapped in different tales. Tabitha must march around the world until
      she wears out seven pairs of iron shoes, and Amira sits atop a glass mountain, waiting for her prince. But when
      Tabitha accidentally climbs Amira's mountain, both stories go flying off the rails.</p>

    <h3 id="link11">"Godmeat" - by <em>Martin Cahil</em></h3>
    <p>Posted on 20/12/2020</p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/5/8/c7499685-49f2-4e9f-8f76-6380b2267cf5-lightspeed-new.jpg?w=632&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"
        alt="Godmeat">
      <figcaption>Godmeat</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>"Godmeat" does literally mean "god meat," so... you know... proceed at your own risk and read at your own
      discretion. But if the idea of <strong>murdering ancient godlike beasts</strong> and then cutting them up into steaks appeals to
      your fantasy brain, then Godmeat is the <strong>creepy</strong>, <em>weird</em>, <em>wildly imaginative</em> story for you (just maybe don't read
      it while eating). </p>
